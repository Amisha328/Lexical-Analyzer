# Lexical-Analyzer

### Introduction

Lexical Analysis is the first phase of compiler used for specifying **patter-action language** called **Lex.** Its main task is to read the input character and produce as output a sequence of tokens that the parser uses for syntax analysis.

Lexical Analyzer reads the input from the input.txt file and display all the tokens in input file in the Output file.
